# Recording Studio Website using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap

This project is a website from a fictional recording studio that I made up for this assignment from the CS50W Web Development Course at HarvardX.
The website contains 4 different pages:

-> Home page (index.html) - contains some basic info about the studio and some pictures.

-> About page (about.html) - contains some goals and objectives of the company in bootstrap cards and some more photos.

-> Recording page (recording.html) - contains the records that were recorded in the studio. I used the bootstrap grid to put the albums side by side and made it responsive to the size of the window.

->About page(about.html) - contains a table with the studio's services prices and a contact form to booking sessions and recordings.\n

I used a template navbar from bootstrap and changed the color of the components, as with the buttons from the form.
The media query that I implemented was a font-size modifier. On small screens, the font of the whole body tag gets bigger.
I also put a simple footer with my name on it.
All the photos I've taken from Google Images and are not mine.

The style.scss is my sass file and style.css is my css file for the page.

Thank you!
